# base-wsl-c-cpp
Some boilerplate for working with C/C++ projects in Windows using WSL.

1. Install WSL
2. apt install build-essentials gdb
3. Install C/C++ extension in VSCode
4. Create [tasks.json](.vscode/tasks.json)
    Ctl+Shift+P -> Configure Tasks
5. Create [launch.json](.vscode/launch.json)
    Ctl+Shift+P -> Debug: Add Configuration

Build:
Ctl+Shift+B

Debug:
select "(gdb) Launch" or F5

## Makefile
Explanation of the Makefile Components
Variables:

CXX: Specifies the C++ compiler (g++ in this case).
CXXFLAGS: Compiler flags (-std=c++11 sets the C++ standard to C++11, -Wall enables most compiler warnings).
SRCDIR, INCDIR, BUILDDIR: Directories for source files, header files, and build artifacts.
TARGET: Name of the final executable.


File Lists:
SRCS: List of source files (*.cpp) in the src directory.
OBJS: List of object files (*.o) generated from source files.
DEPS: Dependency files (*.d) generated by the compiler.

Targets:
all: Default target that builds the executable specified by $(TARGET).
$(TARGET): Links the object files ($(OBJS)) into the final executable.
$(BUILDDIR)/%.o: Rule to compile each .cpp file into a corresponding .o file in the build directory.
-include $(DEPS): Includes dependency files to handle header file changes.

Clean Target (clean):
Removes all generated object files, dependency files, and the executable.


Phony Targets:
all and clean are marked as .PHONY to ensure they are always executed, even if files with those names exist.


### Using the Makefile
Build the Project:
Run make or make all to compile and link the executable.


Clean Up:
Run make clean to delete all generated files and start fresh.
